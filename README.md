#Stock Analysis for Steve

	The goal of this project is not only to look at the client's favored stock, but to compare it to how a much larger group of publicly traded companies preformed.

## Results

	Unable to compare results of stock performance because even though there is no bug the "Return" formula isn't running correctly. 

##Summary

	I could not get the original code to run due to a bug, the refactored code for 2017 and 2018 only took 0.09375secs. to run.
